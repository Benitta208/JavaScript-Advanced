The JavaScript Advanced tasks focus on mastering complex programming concepts and writing efficient, high-performance code. These tasks enhance problem-solving abilities and prepare developers for real-world applications, optimizing both frontend and backend workflows.

✔️ Advanced ES6+ Concepts – Master features like destructuring, spread/rest operators, template literals, and advanced object handling.
✔️ Asynchronous Programming – Work with Promises, async/await, event loops, and handling concurrent operations.
✔️ Functional Programming – Implement concepts like pure functions, immutability, currying, and higher-order functions.
✔️ Data Structures & Algorithms – Solve problems using recursion, memoization, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and sorting techniques.
✔️ Closures & Prototypes – Deep dive into closures, lexical scoping, prototype inheritance, and Object-Oriented JavaScript.
✔️ Design Patterns – Implement Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Module patterns to write scalable and maintainable code.
✔️ Performance Optimization – Use debouncing, throttling, lazy loading, and efficient memory management.
✔️ Error Handling & Debugging – Handle exceptions gracefully using try...catch, custom errors, and debugging tools.
✔️ Browser APIs & Web Performance – Utilize Web Workers, Service Workers, IndexedDB, and optimize for speed and responsiveness.
