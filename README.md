🚀 JavaScript Advanced Tasks
This repository contains advanced JavaScript tasks designed to enhance problem-solving skills, optimize performance, and improve proficiency in modern JavaScript concepts. These tasks cover asynchronous programming, data structures, design patterns, and performance optimization to help developers build scalable and efficient applications.

Functional Programming
✔️ Higher-order functions, currying, and composition
✔️ Immutability and pure functions for predictable behavior
✔️ Using map, filter, reduce, and other functional patterns

 Data Structures & Algorithms
✔️ Recursion, memoization, and dynamic programming
✔️ Implementing stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs
✔️ Sorting and searching algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search)

Closures & Prototypes
✔️ Understanding lexical scoping and closure behavior
✔️ Deep dive into prototype chain and prototype inheritance
✔️ Object-oriented programming (OOP) with ES6 classes

 Design Patterns
✔️ Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Module patterns
✔️ Writing reusable and maintainable code using patterns
✔️ Applying MVC and MVVM architecture in JavaScript

 Performance Optimization
✔️ Efficient memory management, garbage collection strategies
✔️ Using debouncing and throttling for optimized event handling
✔️ Lazy loading, code splitting, and minimizing reflows/repaints

 Error Handling & Debugging
✔️ Proper use of try...catch, custom errors, and debugging techniques
✔️ Handling async errors using .catch() and try/catch blocks
✔️ Using browser DevTools and logging best practices

 Browser APIs & Web Performance
✔️ Working with Web Workers and Service Workers
✔️ Utilizing IndexedDB for client-side storage
✔️ Optimizing rendering and improving web app performance

 Node.js & Backend Integration
✔️ Event-driven architecture and working with Streams
✔️ Authentication, authorization, and JWT handling
✔️ RESTful API development and database integration
